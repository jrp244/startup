Elevator pitch:
Have you ever struggled to coordinate with your team to win pokemon tournaments? Have you ever found that your team of pokemon has a glaring flaw that you didn't catch when building your team? This is where having a website to refer to helps greatly with coordinationg and planning. I will create a competitive pokemon website for the BYU esports club. It will be useful in building teams and then seeing what threats our teams can counter and what we are weak too. It will be a critical reasource to  help us win against other colleges in our CVL tournaments this semester and next. 

Key Features: 
-A login and account feature to allow for teams to be saved and created.
-A section to add common pokemon and move sets to see what we might be up against.
-A place where we can see a type chart and see weakness for our teams.
-A scoreboard to see win/losses in our tournaments. 

Description of technology used:
-Authentication: Will use login/authenticate for account creation.
-Database: Will store all the pokemon teams and player details in a database. 
-Websocket data: Scoreboard will be update in real-time.
